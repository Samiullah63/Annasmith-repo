# Annasmith-repo
This is my second repository
<br>
People often call me angel 
<br>
Actual name of mine is Maryam Jo.
I used to live in Kabul with my mother and some chickens.
<br>
My father left my mom when I was 4 years old.
My father still loves me more than other daughters ( from 1st and 3rd marrige )
<br>
My mother and I lived a very tough life in the past when we're in Kabul.
The Taliban upstream pushed us to the streets of San Fransisco.
<br>
We are alone here as we were in Kabul.
Then day come when I was walking along a nearby alley. 
I found an old man watching me coming along.
His face was shaking, eyes were wet, looks like he had found someone he lost in the past.
<br>
Yes, he did find his lost daughter.
<br>
The daughter which he loved more than any other thing.
<br>
I accepted him as my father and take him home, my mother! she is on the meds now batteling with cancer.
<br>
When Baba get to know this he started crying like a baby, unstopable, voice high to the sky. 
The people from our street watching from the barbed wire of our house.
<br>
The following night we enjoyed the most delicious dinner of our lives. White rice with red beans. Simple!
We celebrated this reunion. My mother looking better today.
